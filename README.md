# Image-captioning

This project was primarily developed using Google Colab.
However, you can also run it on other platforms like Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment.

About:

-The code works with an image located inside the repository.

-The path to the image is already provided in the code — no need to change it unless you move or rename the image file.

How to Run:

1) Open the notebook in Google Colab or your preferred environment.

2) Make sure you have the required libraries installed.

Run the cells — the image will be loaded automatically from the given path.

Notes:-
If you want to use a different image, replace the file at the given path or update the path in the code.
